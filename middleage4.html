     <h1>STRESS OF FUTURE</h1>

             <h3>Know that you’re not seeing every option.</h3>
             <p>When uncertainty strikes, our mind goes to work trying to predict how things will turn out. We choose from the options that are apparent to us—the ones we can see in the moment. But those options are never the whole story In the middle of uncertainty around my new business, I could only see a couple very limited possibilities. I could fail miserably. That possibility was clear. Or I could squeak by. Those were about the only options I could even fathom.Although something in me knew that there were many, many more possibilities, I continually came up blank.</p>
         </li>

             <h3>Fight the urge to concretize.</h3>
             <p>Let your thoughts be fluid. Allow them to float in and out of your mind rather than making them rigid or fixed. When we want to know what’s going to happen, we do what Pema Chodron calls “concretize our thoughts.” We make them feel real and solid, like concrete. They become unyielding, even when they are so often fear-based and not true.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
             <h3>Lean into it.</h3>
             <p>“I’m not sure what’s coming but I’ll handle it” is better than, “What’s going on here?!?” “The unknown feels scary, but I’ve been here before” is much better than, “This feels like torture!”Again, it’s about slowing down your thoughts a little. Soften them, take the edge off, and lean into uncertainty.No one is suggesting you dive in head first and savor every second of it. Not yet, anyway. Just dip a toe in the water and see that you can “do” uncertainty. </p>             
         </li>
         <li>
             <h3>Look back at everything that has turned out okay.</h3>
             <p>Remember all the uncertainty in your past and how it always worked itself out. It really has, hasn’t it? Certainty is an illusion. It’s not real and it has no real connection with how well things turn out.Try to remember a few times when you felt completely lost and uncertain only to experience an amazing outcome.I remembered when I was trying to get pregnant. My husband and I tried for a year and a half before we finally saw a positive test result.And now, watching my two year old run around and looking back on those 18 months that felt like torture at the time, I see so clearly that everything turned out exactly the way it was always meant to. The timing was perfect.</p>

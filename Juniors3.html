<h1>FINANCIAL ISSUE</h1>
<h2>Self-help for the individual</h2>
<ul>
<h3></h3>

<li>Do your homework. People don’t like to study money or the realities of a budget. It’s a social behavior that often gets ignored. But it’s important to understand there are pros and cons to each financial decision. Choosing option A instead of option B can be difficult, but our resources, including money, are limited. Each decision has consequences and benefits. Figure out what they are before deciding which one is right for you.</li>
<li>Define your values. Once you recognize that each financial decision has consequences and benefits, set goals that are consistent with your own values. It’s easier to reach your goals when they are important to you.</li>
<li>Enjoy the ride. Financial decision making is a lifelong process. Each stage of life has a readiness-to-learn aspect. Ask yourself where money is relevant in your life. It could be something big like college or a new car. It could also be something small in comparison like the next iPhone. All of those choices are an expression of your values.</li>

<p>If in doubt, seek professional advice from your medical practitioner and also from counselors and psychologists who will do their best to find out which coping strategy works best for you. We are all unique people and there's no one size fits all solution.</p>

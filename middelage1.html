     <h2>Self-help for the individual</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>Think about the changes you need to make at work in order to reduce your stress levels and then take action. Some changes you can manage yourself, while others will need the cooperation of others.</li>
         <li>Talk over your concerns with your employer or human resources manager.</li>
         <li>Make sure you are well organised. List your tasks in order of priority. Schedule the most difficult tasks of each day for times when you are fresh, such as first thing in the morning.</li>
         <li>Take care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly.</li>
         <li>Consider the benefits of regular relaxation. You could try meditation or yoga.</li>
         <li>Make sure you have enough free time to yourself every week.</li>
         <li>Don’t take out your stress on loved ones. Instead, tell them about your work problems and ask for their support and suggestions.</li>
         <li>Drugs, such as alcohol and tobacco, won’t alleviate stress and can cause additional health problems. Avoid excessive drinking and smoking.</li>

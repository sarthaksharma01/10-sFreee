    <h1>SOCIAL ISSUE</h1>
    <h2>How to help elderly facing social isolation</h2>
     <ul>
            <p>Plan a small trip once in a while with your loved one. Just a stroll for half an hour to a nearby park or getaway can help them feel fresh and drive away depression and feelings of loneliness. Offering them a ride also helps them keep in touch with their social surroundings and brings about a sense of independence.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
             <p>Motivate them to remain occupied with hobbies and interests. Making available opportunities to volunteer will give them a sense of purpose which in turn will make them feel important.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
                <p>Those who are religiously inclined should be encouraged to visit their places of worship regularly. Praying or meditation help to develop a mind that is fresh and free of unwanted thoughts.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
             <p>With old age come difficulties in hearing and vision. Elderly people who have such issues, that are undiagnosed and left untreated, hesitate to face social situations. Embarrassment due to difficulty in communication with others slowly makes them avoid socialising. This leads to social isolation.</p>
         </li>     
         <li>
             <p>Elderly persons experiencing incontinence tend to stay at home and avoid social interactions for fear of embarrassment. Caregivers and family members of these seniors should be more careful and prompt in providing incontinence solutions so that they feel more confident and improve social interactions, consequently avoiding feelings of loneliness.</p>
         </li>
     </ul>

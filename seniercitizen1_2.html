     <h1>MEMORY LOSS</h1>
     <ul>
         <li>
             <h3>Include physical activity in your daily routine</h3>
             <p>Physical activity increases blood flow to your whole body, including your brain. This might help keep your memory sharp.For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity, such as jogging — preferably spread throughout the week. If you don't have time for a full workout, squeeze in a few 10-minute walks throughout the day.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
             <h3>Stay mentally active</h3>
             <p>Just as physical activity helps keep your body in shape, mentally stimulating activities help keep your brain in shape — and might keep memory loss at bay. Do crossword puzzles. Play bridge. Take alternate routes when driving. Learn to play a musical instrument. Volunteer at a local school or community organization.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <h3>Socialize regularly</h3>
            <p>Social interaction helps ward off depression and stress, both of which can contribute to memory loss. Look for opportunities to get together with loved ones, friends and others — especially if you live alone.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
             <h3>Get organized</h3>
             <p>You're more likely to forget things if your home is cluttered and your notes are in disarray. Jot down tasks, appointments and other events in a special notebook, calendar or electronic planner. You might even repeat each entry out loud as you jot it down to help cement it in your memory. Keep to-do lists current and check off items you've completed. Set aside a place for your wallet, keys, glasses and other essentials.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
             <h3>Sleep well</h3>
             <p>Sleep plays an important role in helping you consolidate your memories, so you can recall them down the road. Make getting enough sleep a priority. Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep a day.</p>
         </li>

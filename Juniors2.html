<h1>PEER PRESSURE STRESS ISSUE</h1>
<h3>Below are a few methods parents can use to help their teen say no to peer pressure:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't lecture your teen, talk to them. To have an effective conversation, create a two-way dialogue with your teen instead of just telling them what they should do or how they should react in certain situations.</li>
<li>It's never too late to start the conversation, or too early. Talk often and openly about over-the-counter cough medicine abuse and other risky behaviors with your teen.</li>
<li>Give your teen the tools they need to make healthy decisions. Empower them to say no and inform them about the health risks associated with medicine abuse.</li>
<li>Know the signs of abuse; monitor your medicine cabinet and your teen's on and offline activities. If you suspect they are abusing cough medicine, talk to them. Don't wait until it's too late.</li>
<li>Talk through ways your teen can handle different scenarios in which their friends are peer pressuring them to engage in risky behaviors such as drug or medicine abuse. Help them devise an “exit” plan in case they find themselves in an uncomfortable situation with their peers.</li>
<p>If in doubt, seek professional advice from your medical practitioner and also from counselors and psychologists who will do their best to find out which coping strategy works best for you. We are all unique people and there's no one size fits all solution.</p>

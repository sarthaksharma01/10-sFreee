        <h3>Maintain Frequent Contact</h3>
            <p>There is nothing holding you back from reaching out to your parents on a regular basis. Technology has even made it possible for you to see their faces even when you are not right there with them.You might be used to calling mom or dad once a week or twice a month. Create the time if you have a busy schedule.You can call your parents in the morning when going to work. You might even decide to call them after work hours. You should even do more if any of them has lost a significant other. Losing a significant other means there is a greater risk of depression. Your everyday call will help suppress any form of boredom. Your parents will even make receiving a call from you a part of their daily to-do list.</p>

             <h3>Visit Your Parents More Often</h3>
             <p>You are the only one who knows how frequently you visit your parents. No matter the number of times you visit, you have to make an increase in that number.

You might have a challenge in visiting them as often as you would love as a result of distance. However, you can still schedule quality time for them using video call platforms like Skype or other mobile application that helps you connect to a person via video calls. </p>

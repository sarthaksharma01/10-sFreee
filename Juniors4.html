<h1>ACADEMIC STRESS ISSUE</h1>
<h2>Self-help for the individual</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use good time management techniques. Some studies have shown that managing your time well results in a greater reduction in stress than do other common stress relievers, such as leisure activity.</li>
<li>Reconsider your commitments. Many Northwestern undergrads find that they've taken on more than they can reasonably manage. While it's important to stay involved in community, it's equally critical to allow adequate time for studying and reflection.</li>
<li>Stay balanced. Be sure you are taking time to get enough sleep, to eat well and exercise, to maintain friendships, and to engage in other activities that recharge your batteries.</li>
<li>Take time to relax. Spend some time each day on activities that can help reduce your stress. Use mindfulness techniques. Try a few minutes of guided relaxation.</li>
<li>Seek academic support when you need it. There are many resources around campus, including tutoring and peer study groups, that can help you optimize your academic skills and course knowledge.</li>
<li></li>
<p>If in doubt, seek professional advice from your medical practitioner and also from counselors and psychologists who will do their best to find out which coping strategy works best for you. We are all unique people and there's no one size fits all solution.</p>

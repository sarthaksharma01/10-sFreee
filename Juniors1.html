<h3>Bullying Survival Tips</h3>

Here are some things you can do to combat psychological and verbal bullying. They're also good tips to share with a friend as a way to show your support:

<li>Ignore the bully and walk away. It's definitely not a coward's response — sometimes it can be harder than losing your temper. Bullies thrive on the reaction they get, and if you walk away or ignore hurtful emails or instant messages, you're telling the bully that you just don't care. Sooner or later the bully will probably get bored with trying to bother you. Walk tall and hold your head high. Using this type of body language sends a message that you're not vulnerable.</li>
<li>Hold the anger. Who doesn't want to get really upset with a bully? But that's exactly the response he or she is trying to get. Bullies want to know they have control over your emotions. If you're in a situation where you have to deal with a bully and you can't walk away with poise, use humor — it can throw the bully off guard. Work out your anger in another way, such as through exercise or writing it down (make sure you tear up any letters or notes you write in anger).</li>
<li>Don't get physical. However you choose to deal with a bully, don't use physical force (like kicking, hitting, or pushing). Not only are you showing your anger, you can never be sure what the bully will do in response. You are more likely to be hurt and get into trouble if you use violence against a bully. You can stand up for yourself in other ways, such as gaining control of the situation by walking away or by being assertive in your actions.</li>

<h2>Self-help for the individual</h2>

<li>Make Your Health a Priority</li>
<li>Find Emotional Support and Validation</li>
<li>Educate Yourself About Workplace Bullying</li>
<li>Change How You View the Experience</li>
<li>Find Closure and a New Beginning  </li>

<p>If in doubt, seek professional advice from your medical practitioner and also from counselors and psychologists who will do their best to find out which coping strategy works best for you. We are all unique people and there's no one size fits all solution.</p>

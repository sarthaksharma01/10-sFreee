    <h1> Stress due to Relationship Issues</h1>
    <p id="p1">Relationship stress can come from each individual’s need to address personal concerns or from issues within the relationship, such as household finances, a lack of communication or diminished excitement. Stress doesn’t have to become so bad it causes serious relationship strife or -- even worse -- physical or psychological health challenges. Finding healthy ways to cope with relationship stress can revitalize the partnership and improve overall health.</p>

    <h2><ul> Identify Stress Symptoms</ul> </h2>
    <p id="p2">
            When you are able to identify stress symptoms you will be better equipped to handle them when they arise. Do you have an overexcited stress response -- as described by Jeanne Segal, Ph.D., Melinda Smith, M.A., and Lawrence Robinson in the HelpGuide.org article titled "Stress Relief in the Moment: Using Your Senses to Quickly Change Your Response to Stress" -- and become snappish and short-tempered toward your partner when you are stressed? Does your partner have an underactive stress response and become moody and withdrawn? In her Psych Central articled titled "How Couples Can Help Each Other De-Stress and Improve Their Relationship," quoting author and licensed clinical social worker Judy Ford, Margarita Tartakovsky reports that “Couples often become so accustomed to unchecked stress that they barely recognize and often overlook the destructive ramifications.” Tartakovsky also notes that dependence on mild-altering substances, such as alcohol and illicit drugs, can also indicate increased stress levels. Learn to identify the signs of stress in you and your partner so that you can address the problem.
